                3.1. All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of the order price. Afri Meal retains the right to refuse any request made by you. If your order is accepted, we will inform you by email, SMS, or via the App. When placing an order, you undertake that all the details you provide to us are true and accurate, that you are the authorised user of the credit or debit card used to place your order and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the goods.

It is essential to check if the information you have given is correct and if it is not; please correct it before selecting the “Place Order” button. Once you complete the process of ordering, you are into a contract with the restaurant. When you place an order you will receive an acknowledgement e-mail and/or mobile interface confirming receipt of your order - this email and or interface will only be an acknowledgement and will not constitute acceptance of your order.
                
                3.3. Cancelling the Order: You may cancel an order without charge at any time before the Restaurant has accepted the order. If you wish to cancel an order before it becomes accepted, please contact us immediately, via our Application. If the Restaurant hasn’t accepted the order, we will refund your payment (excluding any discount, or Voucher that was applied to the order). If you cancel any order after it becomes accepted, you will be charged the full price for the Items, and if the delivery has been dispatched you will also be charged for delivery.  
                
                Afri Meal or Restaurants may notify you that an order has been cancelled at any time. You will not be charged for any orders cancelled by us or the Restaurant, and we will reimburse you for any payment already made. We may also apply credit to your account to reflect the inconvenience caused.
                
                3.4. Prices, Payment & Offers: Prices include VAT that have been added by the Restaurants. You confirm that you are using our Service for personal, non-commercial use. Afri Meal may operate dynamic pricing some of the time, which means that prices of Items and delivery may change while you are browsing. Prices can also change at any time at the discretion of the Restaurant. We reserve the right to charge a Service Fee, which may be subject to change, for the provision of our Services. You will be notified of any applicable Service Fee and taxes prior to purchase on the checkout page on our Application. No changes will affect existing confirmed orders, unless there is an obvious pricing mistake. Nor will changes to prices affect any orders in process and appearing within your basket, provided you complete the order within 2 hours of creating the basket. If you do not conclude the order before the 2 hour cut-off the items will be removed from your basket automatically and the price change will apply. If there is an obvious pricing mistake we will notify you as soon as we can and you will have the choice of confirming the order at the original price or cancelling the order without charge and with a full refund of any money already paid.  Where Afri Meal or any Restaurant makes a delivery, we or the Restaurant may also charge you a delivery fee. This will be notified to you during the order process before you complete your order.
                
                The total price of your order will be set out on the checkout page on our Application, including the prices of Items and Delivery and applicable Service Fees and taxes.
                
                Payment for all Items and deliveries can be made on our Application by credit or debit card through Stripe. Also, please be advised that your use of Stripe is subject to the terms and conditions, including the privacy policies, of Stripe. By using Stripe, you hereby accept the Stripe API Terms of Service found here: https://stripe.com/gb/checkout/legal.
                
                Once your order has been confirmed your credit or debit card will be authorised and the total amount marked for payment. Payment is made directly to Afri Meal acting as agent on behalf of the Restaurant only. Payment may also be made by using vouchers or account credit. Use of these is subject to Afri Meal’s Voucher and Account Credit Terms.
                
                We are authorised by Restaurants to accept payment on their behalf and payment of the price of any Items or delivery charges to us will fulfil your obligation to pay the price to the Restaurant. In some cases, you can alternatively make your payment in cash directly to the Restaurant by paying the rider at the time of delivery.  Where cash payment is possible, this will be made clear on our Application before you place your order.
                
                Restaurants sometimes make special offers available through our Application. These are visible when you look at a Restaurant menu. These offers are at the discretion of the Restaurant. Unless the offer terms state a fixed or minimum period for which an offer will be available, it can be withdrawn at any time, unless you have already placed an order based on the offer and we have sent the Confirmation Notice.
                
                3.5. Delivery/Collection: The delivery and collection estimated time had been provided by the restaurant, however we do not guarantee that your order will be delivered or available for collection within the given time. We will attempt delivery at the address you provide to us when you place your order. If you need to change the delivery location after you have placed your order, we may be able to change the address to an alternative one if you let us know before the rider has been dispatched, and the new address is within the same zone as the address you originally ordered your Item to. If we cannot change the delivery address, you have the option to cancel the order, but if the order has been accepted by the restaurant you will be charged the full price for the Item, and if the rider has been dispatched you will also be charged for delivery.
                
                You will still be charged for the Item and for delivery in the event of a failed delivery if you have caused such failure for any reason. Reasons you might cause a delivery to fail include (but are not limited to):   
                
                You do not come to the door, did not pick up the phone when the rider contacted you using the contact information you have provided us and/or you picked up the phone but then failed to provide access within a reasonable amount of time, and the rider is unable to find a safe location to leave the food.
                The rider refuses to deliver the Item to you in accordance with Section 3.7 (Age Restricted Products).
                
                3.6. Pickup Orders: Pickup allows you to place an order on the App and pick it up from the Restaurant in the UK. You have the opportunity to choose between picking up your order and having it delivered to your address while placing your order on the App. You do not need to pay a delivery fee for pickup orders.
                
                The Restaurants each decide their own operating hours. That means that the availability of our Service, and the range of Partner Restaurants from which you can order to pick-up, depends on the Restaurants in your area. If you try to place a Pick-up Order with a Restaurant outside the operating hours of the Restaurant, or the Application is otherwise unavailable for any reason, we will notify you that ordering will not be possible.
                
                When you place a Pick-up Order which is accepted by the Restaurant, you will be notified when the order is ready for pickup. You will be required to collect your Items directly from the Restaurant at the Pick-up Location. The pickup location would be the address of the Restaurant which is displayed on the App. You must arrive at the Restaurant to collect your Items once you’re notified of its readiness. The Restaurants will hold your Items for you until their business closes for the day. If you fail to collect your Items before the Restaurant’s close of business, they may dispose of your Items. You will still be charged for the Item in the event you fail to pick-up your Item from the Restaurant.
                
                
                3.7. Compensation: If you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Restaurant and wish to seek a refund, a proportionate price reduction or any other compensation, you should contact us to deal with your complaint. You can contact our Customer Care Team on support@afrimeal.co.uk within 24 hours of placing your Order and one of our Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to request compensation on your behalf. Please note, however, that the legal contract for the supply and purchase of Products is between you and the Restaurant that you place your Order with. We have no control over Restaurants and the quality of the Products or service that they provide, and we are not able to provide, and have no responsibility or liability for providing, any compensation to you on behalf of any Restaurant.
                
                3.8. Age Restricted and Regulated Products: Age restricted products (including, without limitation, alcohol, tobacco and cigarettes) can only be sold and delivered to persons aged 18 or over. By placing an order for an age restricted product, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old. Afri Meal operates an age verification policy whereby customers ordering age restricted products will be asked by the rider to provide proof that they are aged 18 or over before the delivery is completed. The rider may refuse to deliver any age restricted product to any person unless they can provide valid photo ID proving that they are aged 18 or over. The Restaurant and the rider may refuse to deliver alcohol to any person who is, or appears to be under the influence of either alcohol or drugs. Orders for items containing alcohol may only be delivered to a location that is a residential or business address. If delivery of any age restricted product is refused, you will still be charged for the relevant Item and for delivery.

                DISCLAIMERS

We may make changes to the material on the App, or to the functionality, Products and prices described on it, at any time without notice. The material on the App may be out of date, and we make no commitment to update that material.
                
                Allergy, dietary and other menu information: When a Restaurant signs up with us, they have to provide us with up-to-date menu information. We then include this on their dedicated page on the App. Where this information includes allergy or other dietary information, we will do our best to republish this information on the website or app exactly as it appears on the restaurant's menu. If you have, or someone you are ordering for has, a concern about food allergies, intolerances or other dietary preferences, you should use your discretion before placing your order.
                
                Restaurant actions and omissions: The legal contract for the supply and purchase of Products is between you and the Restaurant that you place your Order with. We have no control over the actions or omissions of any Restaurants. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you acknowledge and accept the following by using the App:
                
                1. We do not give any undertaking that the Products ordered from any Restaurant through the App will be of satisfactory quality or suitable for your purpose and we disclaim any such warranties.
                
                2. Estimated times for deliveries and collections are provided by the Restaurants and are only estimates. Neither we nor the Restaurants guarantee that Orders will be delivered or will be available for collection within the estimated times.
                
                3. We encourage all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and to communicate any rejection promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as reasonably practicable if a Restaurant rejects your Order. However, we do not guarantee that Restaurants will accept and fulfil all Orders, and Restaurants have the discretion to reject Orders at any time because they are too busy, if you fail to provide proof of age for purchases of alcohol, cigarettes or other smoking products when required, due to weather conditions or for any other reason. Restaurants will not be obliged to deliver an Order to an address outside of their set delivery radius, which may change from time to time.
